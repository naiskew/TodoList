TodoList
========

this is my Todolist program that allow for adding, editing, deleting, 

searching  and save to database with MySQL.

this program show the list by sort on date, time and the name of todo.

I program it with HTML, JavaScript,

JQuery = jquery-1.8.3.js (need to edit the address on todo.php file line 3) ,

PHP =  todoproc.php (need to edit the address on todo.php file line 178) ,

and MySQL = I run it on my web server so the machine that run this program need to have MySQL install
